# 📊 Predicting Indonesia's Poverty Line (2025–2030)

This repository contains a data science project that aims to **predict the national poverty line in Indonesia** for the next 2–5 years using historical data and socio-economic indicators.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a predictive model that can estimate the future **Tingkat Garis Kemiskinan Nasional** (National Poverty Line) of Indonesia, using publicly available data from BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) and additional socio-economic datasets.
